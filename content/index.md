## ./whoami

If youâ€™ve found your way here, you know what I care about -- Computers: making stuff and, breaking stuff. 

I am currently an independent (*read unemployed*) security researcher, exploring everything. Sometimes I write code, other times tragedy.

Besides machina I indulge into research on human psyche. Every piece I read is an excavation into myself, why I do what I do, and what I can do better.

Fair disclaimer before you interact with me -- am a bit acoustic and have ADHD. I am also a TMI enjoyer, you can never give me enough information.

*The notes you will find here are intimate to me and I request that you handle them with tenderness, as I confide in you a piece of my mind.*
