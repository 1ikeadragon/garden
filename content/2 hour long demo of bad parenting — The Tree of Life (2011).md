title: 2 hour long demo of bad parenting — The Tree of Life (2011)
---
I couldn't stomach it after the 1H:23M mark. The abuse was too relatable, too personal. A troubled father using his kids as an outlet of his frustration, controlling his wife, and spinning up a dictatorship within the walls of his house and yard.

I read high reviews online about The Tree of Life (2011). I saw a reel on Instagram mentioning the movie — a reel about "grace". These gave me high expectations but, I couldn't seem to get it. Only good part I found in this film was the mother's narration.

This movie, for now, is beyond my understanding and I haven't taken anything from it, except, maybe a stark reminder to do better than how your dad did to you. 

So my children when they gain sense one day, think to themselves - "I will be a better dad" in inspiration, and not in hate.
